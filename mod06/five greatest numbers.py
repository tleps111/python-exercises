# Write a program that asks the user to enter numbers until they input an empty string
# to quit. At the end, the program prints out the five greatest numbers sorted in 
# descending order. Hint: You can reverse the order of sorted list items by using 
# the sort method with the reverse=True argument.

numbers = []
number = input("Enter a number:")

while number != "":
    numbers.append(int(number))
    number = input("Enter a number: ")

numbers.sort(reverse=True)
print(numbers[0:5])
