# Write a program that asks the user to enter the names of five cities one by on 
# (use a for loop for reading the names) 
# and stores them into a list structure. Finally, the program prints out the names of the cities one by one, one city per line, in the same order they were read as input. 
# Use a for loop for asking the names and a for/in loop to iterate through the list. 

cities = []

for i in range(5):
    cities.append(input("Enter the name of the city: "))

for n in cities:
